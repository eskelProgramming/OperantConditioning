## Getting Started

### Option 1: Live Website

A live browser-based version of [Operant Conditioning](https://eskelprogramming.github.io/OperantConditioning/) is currently available. 
This version is slow and a little buggy, but if you want a quick demo, I recommend checking it out.

### Option 2: Godot Engine
